    <h1>About Robyn</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Robyn Stark (Nee Middleton) has been working with horses and riders of all backgrounds and abilities for the past 24 years. She believes that any horse can enjoy schooling if asked in the right way. She loves her work and finds great pleasure in seeing the partnerships she trains improve and have fun. She has enjoyed competing nationally and internationally but has stepped back to focus on how dressage benefits horses.</p>
      <blockquote>“All horses can benefit from regular dressage training. It is like Pilates for horses... it builds strength and flexibility which improves the horse’s overall well being.”</blockquote>
      <p>Robyn works with people of all ages and is a fully accredited Pony Club coach, is DBS checked, holds a first aid certificate, has attended a safeguarding course and is fully insured.</p>
      <blockquote>“Harmony between horse and rider is very important... If you ask them questions that they can answer correctly their confidence grows and then they start to enjoy what they are doing. Then training them becomes a pleasure.”</blockquote>
      <p>Robyn competed internationally as a Junior, completed work experience at Catherston Stud with Jenny Loriston-Clarke, and later trained at Uplands Stud with David Hunt. She’s worked with a wide range of breeds and experience levels and has been a freelance instructor since 2003. Robyn’s horses have included Kafka—her lifelong partner—and Five Alive (Ellie), with whom she won the CHAPS Non Native Ridden Championship in 2007.</p>
