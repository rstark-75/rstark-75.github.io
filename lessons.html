<h1>Lessons & Schooling</h1>

<p><strong>Robyn is based in Burwash near Heathfield, East Sussex.</strong> She is available to give lessons or school horses at your own yard or at hired arenas. She covers East Sussex, Kent, and West Sussex. Individual sessions are 45 minutes and are priced at £45 plus travel. If she is schooling your horse when you are not around, she allows an extra 15 minutes for tack up and wash down, charged at £5 extra. Special discounts are available for locals (within a 5 mile radius) or when there's more than one booking at the same yard.</p>

<p>Currently she does a monthly visit to Surrey/Hampshire covering Leatherhead, Guildford, Elstead, Liphook, Midhurst and nearby areas. Sessions are 45 minutes and priced at £55 including travel. Similar visits or clinics can be arranged for other areas.

<p>By request of Romney Marsh Pony Club, Robyn has become a fully accredited Pony Club Coach and runs regular training sessions for members who are keen to improve their flat work in Sandhurst, East Sussex. RMPC members receive a special discount. Please get in touch to find out more.</p>

<p>Robyn has a wireless training system that can be used during lessons. In larger arenas, or if you struggle with hearing, this is a very useful piece of equipment. You can use your own standard jack earphones or the one provided.</p>
